This directory contains the explicit EIS and EIS+ methods that are SSP.

1.The explicit SSP methods that are EIS and cannot be postprocessed. The methods have s stages and are of order P=p+1
    a. eEIS_SSP2s3P.mat contains the coefficients of the eSSP-EIS method with s=2 and P=p+1=3
    b. eEIS_SSP2s4P.mat contains the coefficients of the eSSP-EIS method with s=2 and P=p+1=4
    c. eEIS_SSP3s4P.mat contains the coefficients of the eSSP-EIS method with s=3 and P=p+1=4
    d. eEIS_SSP3s5P.mat contains the coefficients of the eSSP-EIS method with s=3 and P=p+1=5
    e. eEIS_SSP3s6P.mat contains the coefficients of the eSSP-EIS method with s=3 and P=p+1=6
