This directory features matlab files that contain the coefficients of explicit EIS methods. 

The methods herein include:
1. EIS methods (that do not admit post-processing): 
Our notation is eEIS(s,P) for explicit methods that cannot be post-processed, with s stages, 
truncation error p=P-1, and overall order P.
      a. eEIS(2,3) with stages s=2 and overall order P=p+1=3; coefficients are contained in the file eEIS_2s3P.mat, 
      b. eEIS(2,5) with stages s=2 and overall order P=p+1=5; coefficients are contained in the file eEIS_2s5P.mat, 
      c eEIS(2,7) with stages s=2 and overall order P=p+1=7; coefficients are contained in the file  eEIS_3s7P.mat.
2. EIS methods (that can be post-processed): 
Our notation is eEIS+(s,P) for explicit methods that can be post-processed, with s stages, 
truncation error p=P-2, and overall order P.
      a. eEIS(2,5) with stages s=2 and overall order P=p+2=5 ofter post-processing; coefficients in the file eEISpp_2s5P.mat,
      b. eEIS(2,6) with stages s=2 and overall order P=p+2=6 ofter post-processing; coefficients in the file eEISpp_2s6P.mat,
      c. eEIS(3,7) with stages s=3 and overall order P=p+2=7 ofter post-processing; coefficients in the file eEISpp_3s7P.mat,
      d. eEIS(4,8) with stages s=4 and overall order P=p+2=8 ofter post-processing; coefficients in the file eEISpp_4s8P.mat.
